              Our tiny home is the place for you to experience what you need -
              rest, reflection, solitude, time with family and friends, a place
              to connect and have fun. Pull up at the pellet stove with your
              book or creative activity. There are toys and games for young and
              older. On sunny, winter days the screened veranda (with windows)
              gets amazingly warm. This is a comfortable dry winter camping
              experience. Snow shoes are available. We are just half hour from
              parks that have excellent skiing trails 🧘🏽‍♀️ 🧩

              On the main floor there is a seat that niftily folds into a double
              bed. There is a small toilet room with a sink and toilet. Showers
              are available in the farmhouse by request during the months the
              water is turned off. The kitchenette is supplied with basic
              kitchen appliances and water. There is a small table with
              cushioned seats. The warmth from the pellet stove is a true,
              northern comfort. Up in the loft are twin mats. These can be made
              up into a queen size bed. We can add a few more mats for another
              child or two. The window gives you a view of part of the farm. The
              loft has a beautiful, handcrafted, stain glass window gifted to us
              by our friend Richard. On sunny days it will surprise you with
              rainbows shining in various places! It is a joy!

              The screened veranda is for sure a place to hang out. It has seats
              for lounging and a 70s lamp to light up your pages. The wifi
              access is strongest in this space. Great spot for cool drinks day
              or night. No bugs! 🐞 On the deck by the front door are 2 chairs
              to have your coffee ☕️ in the morning sun. The garden is around
              you. You may find some greens or other veggies to harvest in the
              space designated for guests. Feel free to enjoy garden walks! The
              fire pit 🔥 (with wood) and picnic table is just outside your
              door. We have the garden gazebo for some meals there or just hang
              out. The bigger gazebo has hammocks, swing and tables. It is all
              yours to use.

              There is a torpedo ball game that lots of people enjoy. The
              2-story playhouse and backyard is a place of imagination. There
              are swings for small and tall. The animals and birds will love
              your attention too! Maybe the chickens will lay an egg or 2 for
              your breakfast! We have orange, white and black in our cat family.
              Find Judah’s Trail or take a long, quiet walk on a country road.
              We can also provide you with bikes. Come enjoy a stay on our farm!
